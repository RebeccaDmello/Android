FABDemo is an application which has used Fragments. Fragments in Android provide some features like some options in the Menu Bar, a Floating Action Button and some customizable Activities

Features:
- An Array List is used to store the Items which are added when the FAB is Clicked
- A SnackBar is displayed which has "undo" functionality which removes the item from the list
- The Key Difference between a Toast and a Snack Bar is that Toast can not have any functionality like onClick whereas in SnackBar we can add customizable functionality.
